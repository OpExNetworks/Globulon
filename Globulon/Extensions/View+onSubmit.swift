/// A custom SwiftUI `ViewModifier` that listens for keyboard dismissal and triggers a given action.

/// This modifier listens for `UIResponder.keyboardWillHideNotification` from the system.
/// When the keyboard is about to be dismissed, it executes the provided closure. This is
/// useful for saving data or reacting to text input completion in forms or text fields.

    /// - Returns: A modified view that responds to keyboard dismissal.
